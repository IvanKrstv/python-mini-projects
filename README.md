# Python Mini Projects

Welcome to the repository "Python mini projects" which consists of small projects, written in Python all by myself. Below this, there are a few words for each of these projects and a small demo. I am always ready to look at any suggestions for optimization of the projects and any ideas for new ones. 


## Guess The Number ðŸ”¢
This is a mini console game for guessing a fixed number. The opponent (the computer) randomly generates an integer number and the user's goal is to guess in it as few attempts as possible. Every input from the user is checked in order to not be possible to crash the code. In the end, when the number is guessed, a message that confirms that and tells in how many attempts the number was guessed, is shown and the user is asked if they would like to play again. By playing again, the user may reach new levels that would increase the range in which the numbers are genereated. 
### [GuessTheNumber](guess-the-number-game/main.py)
### You can play the game directly in your browser [here](https://replit.com/@igkrastev/Guess-The-Number?popupId=a7e1b29d-f854-414b-aa52-9ede0965faa9).

## Python Patterns ðŸŒŸ
This is a simple console app which gives the opportunity to the user to choose from a variety of interesting figures and forms which would be dispalyed on the screen after the respective number from the menu is typed. The idea was given by the lecturer Mario Zahariev from SoftUni. 
### [PythonPatterns](python-patterns/pattern_project.py)
### You can try the mini app online [here](https://replit.com/@igkrastev/PythonPatterns?popupId=aaa073cd-eba4-43e2-aee5-e398ae322edc). (Note: the screen will not be cleared properly online)

## Groq AI Tool ðŸ¤–
This is a console AI chat bot which uses an API key from Groq. It is one of the fastest resposnding chat bots out there. It is yet to be possible to personalize it as I am still working on that. For security reasons I have not put my API key. Instead you can add your own between the "" on the API_KEY variable. You can generate one for free from [here](https://groq.com/).
